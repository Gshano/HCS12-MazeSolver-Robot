# HCS12-MazeSolver-Robot

This project was completed as the final lab challenge for **COE538: Microprocessor Systems** at TMU.  
Working in a **team of 4**, we programmed the **EEbot mobile robot** using **HCS12 assembly language** and the **CodeWarrior IDE** to autonomously navigate and solve a maze.

##  Features
- **Line Following:** Tracks the maze guidance line and navigates S-turns.  
- **Intersection Detection:** Identifies L and T junctions, makes branching decisions, and records paths.  
- **Dead-End Recovery:** Executes bumper-triggered reversals, marks incorrect paths, and updates the maze solution.  
- **Full System Integration:** Combined motor control, guider sensors, bumper switches, and LCD output into one embedded solution.

##  Technical Info
- **Language/Tools:** HCS12 Assembly, CodeWarrior IDE  
- **Concepts:** State machine design, real-time debugging, embedded systems programming  
- **Hardware:** EEbot robot with guider sensors, bumper detectors, and LCD display

##  What I Learned
Working on this project taught me a number of valuable technical and professional skills:

- **Embedded Systems Programming:** Gained hands-on experience writing and debugging low-level **HCS12 assembly code** for real-time applications.  
- **State Machine Design:** Learned how to structure a navigation algorithm using states and transitions to handle intersections, dead ends, and maze retracing.  
- **Hardware–Software Integration:** Improved my ability to connect software routines with hardware components (motors, guider sensors, bumpers, LCD).  
- **Incremental Development & Debugging:** Applied systematic testing strategies, breakpoints, and modular design to debug a large software project effectively.  
- **Team Collaboration:** Worked closely with a group of 4 to divide tasks, integrate subsystems, and manage versioned code — mirroring real-world engineering teamwork.
